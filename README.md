# Testing DocFX for Unity

> [DocFX](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/index.html) usage example for Unity projects

[DocFX](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/) tool generates a clean documentation that looks like the
[Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html) with a manual (written in Markdown) and a scripting
API (from the C# scripts of the project).
